## About JW

I'm an Assistant Professor in the CS department at Michigan Technological University, working at the intersection of Software Engineering and AI. I was a postdoc at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). My undergraduate and master studies were both in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/)  (at [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program at SJTU). I received my PhD in Systems Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). I was a research intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). 


I worked as a software engineer in the industry for nearly a decade at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) (Seattle office), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) (Redmond HQ), and startup ([ArcSite](https://www.arcsite.com/), Shanghai office). I've worked in various areas such as ML-enabled recommender systems, evaluation, scalable backend service, and infrastructure, etc. The projects I launched at Snap increased *millions of daily friend adds* and were one of the yearly highlighted projects in the growth team. I also worked on protecting user safety and privacy (Media reports of my projects: [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-limit-quick-add-teens-203057086.html), [TheVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891104/snapchat-friend-suggestion-limit-teenagers-safety-parental-controls), etc.).

## Research
My research topic is **Trustworthy AIware** - I am passionate about turning the current state of **"AI for Software Engineering"** and **"AI system development"** into a more rigorous science and engineering discipline. My work is closely related to the fields of **human-centered AI, AI alignment, and practical software engineering**. My research emphasizes people (human-centered), feedback loops, and process‚Äîgrounded in a systems-thinking mindset.

## Misc
Outside research and software engineering, I'm interested in the following topics, and I'm happy to talk about it if you find any of them interesting:
- [Á∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶ (Dream of the Red Chamber)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber): Arguably the best 18th-century Chinese novel that describes the rise and fall of Ë¥æ's family. I'm speechless about how great the realism is in the stories. Furthermore, on top of these highly realistic stories, a higher layer exists that implies Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism from Chinese philosophy.
- [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) and history of Relativity, Quantum Physics: If Einstein‚Äôs life and contributions were written as fiction, I‚Äôd have trouble believing they actually happened. His story continues to fascinate me‚Äîboth scientifically and historically.
- Basketball: I (used to) play basketball regularly.
- Reading: with a general focus on Non-fiction, History, and Philosophy.
