## About JW
My original first name is _**杰 (Jie)**_. I also go by _**JW**_. How to pronounce Jie? Please see this [link](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) with audio to learn how to pronounce Jie ("JEE-yeh" is pretty close). I'm happy to accept any approximation, so please feel free to use your favorite variants!

I'm a postdoc at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), working with [Dr. Fatemeh Fard](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/fatemeh-hendijani-fard/) at the intersection of GenAI and Software Engineering. My undergraduate and master studies were done both in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/)  (at [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program at SJTU). I received my PhD in Systems Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). My PhD dissertation is titled ["Towards Formalizing Data-Driven Decision-Making from Big Data: A Systematic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach in Online Controlled Experiments"](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2784774986?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). I was a research intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). I publish under "Jie JW Wu". 

I worked as a software engineer in the industry for nearly a decade at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) (Seattle office), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) (Redmond HQ), and startup ([ArcSite](https://www.arcsite.com/), Shanghai office). I've worked in various areas such as ML-enabled recommender systems, data analysis and evaluations, privacy and security, scalable backend service and infrastructure, etc. The projects I launched at Snap increased *millions of daily friend adds* and were one of the yearly highlighted projects in the growth team. I also worked on protecting user safety and privacy (Media reports: [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-limit-quick-add-teens-203057086.html), [TheVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891104/snapchat-friend-suggestion-limit-teenagers-safety-parental-controls), etc.).

<span style="color:red;"> I'm on the job market: [CV](https://jie-jw-wu.github.io/assets/cv_jw.pdf), [Research Statement](https://jie-jw-wu.github.io/assets/rs_jw.pdf). Please do not hesitate to reach out for any potential opportunities! </span>


## Research

The goal of my research is to build **Trustworthy AIware**. Industries are transitioning from software to AIware, i.e., AI-powered software, which will greatly democratize
software creation and ease the jobs of 27 million professional software engineers in the world. Therefore, How to build reliable and
safe software is critical for society, especially in the current era of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

I'm interested in developing a **systems thinking approach that emphasizes connections, feedback loops, layers, and new processes** to address the trustworthiness issues in AIware. In the future, I plan to use this approach to enhance more dimensions of trustworthiness such as controllability, safety, and robustness for AIware components. I believe systems thinking will provide a new perspective that complements the statistical and reductionist view, a new language for communicating AIware components and relationships, and new tools that form fundamental, practical building blocks in the evolution of trustworthy AIware.

## Misc
Outside research and software engineering, I'm interested in the following topics, and I'm happy to talk about it if you find any of them interesting:
- [红楼梦 (Dream of the Red Chamber)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber): Arguably the best 18th-century Chinese novel that describes the rise and fall of 贾's family. I'm speechless about how great the realism is in the stories. Furthermore, on top of these highly realistic stories, a higher layer exists that implies Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism from Chinese philosophy!
- [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) and history of Relativity, Quantum Physics: If Einstein's deeds were written into a novel, I would not believe that it would happen in the real world!
- Basketball: I (used to) play every week
- Reading: with a general focus on History, Non-fiction, and Philosophy
