## About JW
I'm happy to be called **JW**‚Äîit's easy and casual. But if you're interested in saying my original name, _**Êù∞ (Jie)**_, you're very welcome to try! You can listen to the pronunciation [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ji%C3%A9) (something like ‚ÄúJEE-yeh‚Äù is pretty close). I gladly accept any approximation, so feel free to use whichever version you‚Äôre most comfortable with. I publish under the name ‚ÄúJie JW Wu‚Äù.

I'm a postdoc at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), working with [Dr. Fatemeh Fard](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/fatemeh-hendijani-fard/) at the intersection of Software Engineering and AI. My undergraduate and master studies were done both in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/)  (at [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program at SJTU). I received my PhD in Systems Engineering at [George Washington University](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/). I was a research intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). 

I worked as a software engineer in the industry for nearly a decade at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) (Seattle office), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) (Redmond HQ), and startup ([ArcSite](https://www.arcsite.com/), Shanghai office). I've worked in various areas such as ML-enabled recommender systems, evaluation, scalable backend service, and infrastructure, etc. The projects I launched at Snap increased *millions of daily friend adds* and were one of the yearly highlighted projects in the growth team. I also worked on protecting user safety and privacy (Media reports of my projects: [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-limit-quick-add-teens-203057086.html), [TheVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891104/snapchat-friend-suggestion-limit-teenagers-safety-parental-controls), etc.).

<span style="color:#c2185b;"> **üéì Fully Funded PhD Opportunity Available:** I will be joining an R1 university this fall as a tenure-track assistant professor in the CS department. I'm actively recruiting highly motivated and hard-working students interested in the intersection of Software Engineering and AI (particularly Large Language Models). Exciting projects are available to help you pursue your research dreams. If you're interested, please don't hesitate to reach out via email! </span>

## Research
My research topic is **Trustworthy AIware** - I am passionate about turning the current state of **"AI for Software Engineering"** and **"AI system development"** from art into a rigorous science and engineering discipline. My work is closely related to the fields of **human-centered AI, AI alignment, and practical software engineering**. My research emphasizes people (human-centered), feedback loops, and process‚Äîgrounded in a systems-thinking mindset.

## Misc
Outside research and software engineering, I'm interested in the following topics, and I'm happy to talk about it if you find any of them interesting:
- [Á∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶ (Dream of the Red Chamber)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber): Arguably the best 18th-century Chinese novel that describes the rise and fall of Ë¥æ's family. I'm speechless about how great the realism is in the stories. Furthermore, on top of these highly realistic stories, a higher layer exists that implies Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism from Chinese philosophy.
- [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) and history of Relativity, Quantum Physics: If Einstein‚Äôs life and contributions were written as fiction, I‚Äôd have trouble believing they actually happened. His story continues to fascinate me‚Äîboth scientifically and historically.
- Basketball: I (used to) play basketball regularly.
- Reading: with a general focus on Non-fiction, History, and Philosophy.
